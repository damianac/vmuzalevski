									<h2><a >Structural Repair &<br />
										Strengthening Design</a></h2>
									<p>Structural Strengthening is the process of upgrading structures to improve performance under existing loads or to increase the strength of structural members to carry additional loads.<br />
										Structural Repair changes a property to bring it up to local health and safety standards.<br /></p>

									<p>Subsequent installation of the elevator caused a new opening in the slab.<br />
										To enhance the ultimate/service limit state and to remain the original capacity for the slabs and provide proper supports around the new openings, new RC beams were added.<br />
										In order to keep the original strength capacity, carbon fiber were added to compensate influences caused by the new elevator load. RAM Concept software as well as own spreadsheets were used for the design. I increased my self-confidence by providing a good solution.</p>

									<p>Nad al Sheba Residential Villa project has requested to check the existing Roof slab due to 
										the change in function of architecture and to provide strengthening solution where is required.<br />
										The structure model was done in SAFE software. It was found that new load caused exceeding the permitted limits such as: punching shear and required reinforcement.<br />
										Using techniques like top thickening and Carbon fiber we solved the problem in record time. </p>

									<p>Due to the change in function of architecture, Creek Views project has appointed us to check the existing PT slab at 
										Ground floor  and to provide strengthening 
										solution where is required.<br />
										New model has generated using RAM Concept software. In addition to the usual solutions, the thickness of the thickening was limited  for some columns, therefore the strengthening solution was based on the calculation of studs 
										connected with steel plates from bottom and top sides.<br />
										We are very proud of the ideas and solutions we create.</p>

									<p>The project required adequate passive back-propping for the purpose of repair of 
										damaged columns on first and ground floor. The challenge was to transfer the vertical load from the columns so that there were no harmful effects on the surrounding elements.<br />
										The back props have designed in MIDAS software.<br />
										We have escaped the problems by solving them.</p>

									<p>Carbon fibre plates can be used to improve, increase or repair the performance and resistance of concrete structures. Strategically placed, strengthening plates can be bonded to concrete elements to provide significant increases in carrying capacity and stiffness.<br />
										The above-mentioned project required such a solution, where carbon rods were used in addition to carbon plates.<br />
										New material create more advanced products and replace materials subject to supply disruptions, like rare earth elements.</p>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/pic16.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The project consists of several typical problems such as: strengthening the old and adding new beams, strengthening due to openings in the beam, connection of slab extension with existing PT slabs due to the clashing of Aluminium, anchorage length, etc.<br />
										The solution to each problem is concluded by detailed analysis, calculation and design, using ETABS software.<br />
										Working on projects like this I have developed the knowledge, ability and skills to solve problems quickly, economically and simply.<br /></p>
